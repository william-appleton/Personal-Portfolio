# Personal-Portfolio

For this project I built a personal website from scratch that included three pages, a home/about page, a portfolio page, and a contact page. It was built using Bootstrap, specifically utilizing the Bootstrap grid system. Additionally, special attetntion was paid to making all pages responsive so they can be viewed easily on different screen sizes. 

First deployed: 10/03/20
Updated: 11/14/20

The three pages can be seen at the following links:  
Home/about:  https://william-appleton.github.io/Personal-Portfolio/   
Portfolio:  https://william-appleton.github.io/Personal-Portfolio/portfolio.html   
Contact:  https://william-appleton.github.io/Personal-Portfolio/contact.html
