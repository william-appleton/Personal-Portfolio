# Personal-Portfolio

For this project I built a personal website from scratch that included three pages, a home/about page, a portfolio page, and a contact page. It was built using Bootstrap, specifically utilizing the Bootstrap grid system. Additionally, special attetntion was paid to making all pages responsive so they can be viewed easily on different screen sizes.

The deployed app can be seen here:

And the following gif shows what the deployed application looks like:
